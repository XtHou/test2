# Data Visualisation

The human visual system is amazing, almost half the human brain is devoted to vision. It is our primary sense for understanding the world. To "see" something is to understand it. In this module you will learn that interactive visualisation is one of the most important tools in the data scientists' workbench, helping them to both understand their data and then to communicate what they have discovered to other people.

Data visualisation isn't about creating cool InfoGraphics, it's about creating visualisations that really allow you to understand the data. If you have a strong emotional reaction to the data visualisation it should be because of the underlying data, not the visual representation. To get a feel for the kind of visualisations we will be interested in take a look at the following two TED talks:

* The first is by Hans Rosling [The best stats you've ever seen](http://www.ted.com/talks/hans_rosling_shows_the_best_stats_you_ve_ever_seen?language=ener%20seen) (20 mins) and has become a classic in the data visualisation field. Bill Gates credits one of Rosling's talks for convincing him to give billions of dollars to healthcare projects in developing countries (see [Hans Rosling: the man who makes statistics sing](http://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/tvandradio/10431350/Hans-Rosling-the-man-who-makes-statistics-sing.html)).
* Another great TED talk [The beauty of data visualization](http://ed.ted.com/lessons/david-mccandless-the-beauty-of-data-visualization) (20 minutes) is by David McCandless

And spend some time looking at data visualisations developed by Tableau and Spotfire users

Think about what you like in these visualisation and start to think about whether they are effective in allowing you to understand the underlying data. If they are then try and understand why are they effective. If not, what could be done to improve them.
