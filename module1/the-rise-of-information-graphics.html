<p>Modern scientific and technical drawing techniques originated in the European Renaissance. They underpinned the emergence of modern science, medicine, engineering and architecture. Sketching is the primary tool that architects and engineers use for design, they learn their trade by looking at drawings and plans of existing buildings and machines, and use drawings and plans to communicate with the client and to specify the final design to the builders.</p>
<p>One of the great discoveries of the Renaissance were rules for drawing buildings and machines in linear and parallel perspective and in using measured plans and multi-view orthographic projections to precisely specify their dimensions. These were needed as architects and engineers became separate professions and craft methods of construction were replaced by a separation between design and construction.</p>
<p>Drawings and diagrams are equally important to modern science and medicine. These rely on scientists sharing their observations and theories. Without illustrations it would have been impossible for early scientists to share their observations of nature, of human anatomy, of the new kinds of animals and plants encountered by early European explorers, and of the new worlds visible through the telescope and microscope.</p>
<p>Illustrations were not only important for recording observations, they allowed scientists to communicate new experimental apparatus and designs. And for many scientists, diagrams and mental imagery were tools that allowed them to understand nature and to powerfully convey the resulting theories to other scientists.</p>
<p>Maps also became more important during the Renaissance. Portuguese explorers made their way down the coast of Africa, eventually finding their way around the bottom of Africa to the “Spice Islands” or Moluccas in Indonesia and Christopher Columbus made his way to America, though he persisted in thinking he had actually reached Asia.</p>
<p>Sailors needed accurate maps and map making techniques improved rapidly. Latitude and longitude along with accurate scales became standard. Printing allowed the general public to see maps of these new discoveries and the world’s first atlas was printed in 1570.</p>

<p>It wasn’t until the 17th and 18th centuries that charts and graphs of more abstract material became common. Before that time, tables were the usual way of showing abstract information. For instance, many of the clay tablets surviving from Ancient Mesopotamia contain tables of mathematical exercises completed by novice scribes. One can almost hear the young boys (no girls of course) groaning as they are forced to memorize the very large multiplication tables required for a numbers system built on base 20 and base 60.</p>
<p>One key idea in information graphics is to use location on a plane to represent 2D numerical data-the <em>Cartesian plane</em>. This generalises latitude and longitude used in maps. Rene Descarte and Pierre de Fermat independently invented the basic idea a bit after 1600. In 1686 Edmund Halley was the first to use Cartesian plots for data analysis by fitting a hyperbolic curve to air pressure vs elevation but scatter plots with curve fitting were not commonly used until the 19th century.</p>
<p>Often we want to overlay maps with other kinds of information. Edmund Halley also pioneered this kind of information graphic. These are called <em>thematic maps</em> by cartographers but I prefer to use Edward Tufte’s name for them, <em>data maps</em>. Halley created one of the first data maps in 1686 showing wind direction and another in 1701 using isograms showing magnetic variation. Also noteworthy is a <a href="http://libweb5.princeton.edu/visual_materials/maps/websites/thematic-maps/introduction/hondius-map-1610.jpg">map</a> by Jodocus Hondius from 1607 showing the distribution of religions</p>
<p>Cognitive studies suggest we use spatial reasoning for thinking about time. This is probably why English (and many other languages) implicitly use a spatial metaphor for time: an event occurs before or after another event. One event takes longer than another event. It is surprising therefore, how long it took before time-lines were invented. Joseph Priestly introduced them in 1769: see his <a href="https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PriestleyChart.gif#/media/File:PriestleyChart.gif">Chart of Biography</a>. Before this tables were the standard way to organize temporal data: lists of kings and queens etc. William Playfair built on Priestly’s ideas in 1786 and invented the <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/1/1d/1786_Playfair_-_Chart_of_import_and_exports_of_England_to_and_from_all_North_America_from_the_year_1770_to_1782.jpg">line graph</a>, <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/3/3f/Playfair_Barchart.gif">bar chart</a> and <a href="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/6/63/Playfair-piechart.jpg">pie chart</a>.</p>
<p>From this time there was a fast and furious invention of different kinds of charts, diagrams and graphs for showing all kinds of data. And this hasn’t stopped, there are many hundreds of different kinds of graphics. We will look at the most useful of these in the next three modules.</p>
