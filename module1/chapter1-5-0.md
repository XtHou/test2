# Tools for Data Exploration and Visualisation

Data scientists use a wide variety of different tools for data exploration and visualisation. They fall into three main categories.

### General programming languages

There are two main programming languages used

* Probably the most widely used language for data visualisation and exploration is **R**. While I find R a difficult language to use, it has incredible libraries for data analysis and visualisation. One of the best of the graphics libraries is **ggplot2** by Hadley Wickham.

* The next most common choice is **Python**. This is a nicer language but does not have quite the choice of analysis packages. It is ideal for data wrangling and Python is often used for scrapping and fusing data, then R for exploration and visualisation.

An increasingly popular choice for creating interactive presentation graphics for the web is

* **JavaScript** with the **D3** data visualisation library.  It is not commonly used for other purposes by data scientists.

The great advantage of a programming language approach is that you can, in principle, do anything.

### Generic visual analytics tools

A number of easy to use tools for data analysis and visualisation are available. Examples include

* [SAS Visual Analytics](http://www.sas.com/en_ca/software/business-intelligence/visual-analytics.html) is a visual frontend to many of the SAS analytics tools.
* [Tableau](https://www.tableau.com) is a neasy to use visual analytics tool that is commonly used by business intelligence for interactive exploration of tabular data. It allows interactive graphics to be published on the web. It has a commercial version and a free limited offering called Tableau Public.
* [Qlik](https://www.qlik.com) is another visual analytics tool widely used in business intelligence.

### Application specific visual analytics tools

The third category of tools are systems designed for helping data analysis in a particular application area. There are many of these. As an example look at

* [National Map](https://nationalmap.gov.au) is designed to show Australian government data on top of a map of Australia

* [Scaffold Hunter](http://scaffoldhunter.sourceforge.net) is designed to analyse data in the life sciences with a focus on drug discovery.
