# Activity: Five Design-Sheet Methodology

It is not easy to design effective data visualisations. Like other kinds of design activities such as architecture, graphic design or software design a good approach is to generate, explore and evaluate a wide variety of different design solutions. Sketching and lo-fidelity prototyping allows the designer to explore ideas quickly without getting bogged down in technical details.

The *Five Design-Sheet Methodology (FdS)* was introduced as a way of formalising this approach to design and for teaching design to new data visualisation designers. As you might expect from the name FdS requires the designer to produce 5 design sheets. It is client focussed and relies on an initial discussion with the client to understand the requirements and then discussing design ideas (Sheets 2, 3, 4) with the client.

## Preparation {-}

Determine **what** kind of data is to be visualised and **why** it is to be visualised. Get paper, a ruler and coloured pens and pencils ready to start the design and to work out the **how**.

## Sheet 1: The Ideas Sheet {-}

This is the initial brainstorming sheet. Think about different possible ideas for the design and jot them down. Relax, no idea is bad at this stage. The aim is to fully explore the design space,

1. Generate as many **ideas** as possible, somewhere between 10 and 20. This can be done individually or in a group. Sketch the designs on paper. At this stage they will be mini-ideas, partial half-baked solutions.

2. The next step is to **filter** the mini-ideas, removing duplicates and irrelevant or impossible concepts.

3. Group the mini-ideas into **categories**. Think about if there are some missing categories.

4. **Combine & refine** the mini-ideas into more complete solutions. Think about which visualisations complement one another.

5. **Question** and reflect on what you have created. Do the designs solve the original problem? What are their advantages and disadvantages?Identify which 3 ideas will be explored in more detail in Sheets 2,3 and 4. Choose the best idea and two designs which are also good but which are totally different to it.

## Sheet 2, 3 & 4: Alternative Designs {-}

Now refine the three designs identified in Sheet 1. Produce a sheet for each design with 5 panels

1. **Information**: appropriate meta-information such as title, author and data
2. **Layout**: sketch the final visualisation or interface
3. **Operations**: list the operations the visualisation interface supports using Action -> Result pairs.
4. **Focus/Parti**: Detail the core concept in the visualisation or interface
5. **Discussion**: Discuss the advantages, disadvantages, feasibility of the design. This might be done with the client

## Sheet 5: Realisation {-}

This is the designers final design detailing the concept to be delivered. This contains enough information about the design, functionality and interactions for it to be implemented. It might include

* **Description** of the main design patterns, algorithms or data structures and references
* Underlying **maths** and calculations used in the design such as layout dimensions
* **Software** requirements, dependencies etc
* **Estimates** of cost, time etc
* Any **other** requirements or resources needed.

## Activity {-}

Now its time to try your hand at FdS. Work in pairs.

You have been approached by Monash to design an app that helps students plan their selection of units.

**What**: You have access to all of the information in the handbook for units and courses including requirements for course completion, location and time of unit offerings,  unit dependencies and prohibitions as well as previous SETU evaluations of the units.

**Why**: The app should help students select units and understand the dependencies between units.

Now use the FdS methodology to work out **How**. You can work in groups of two or three people to create the 5 sheets and then present these to the class.
