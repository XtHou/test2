# Introduction to data exploration and visualisation: Overview

This is the first module of six in FIT5147 Data Exploration and Visualisation. This unit introduces statistical and visualisation techniques for the exploratory analysis of data.


## Aims of this module 

After completing this module you will:

* Understand the important roles that visualisation plays in data science: data checking and cleaning, exploration and discovery, and the presentation and communication of results;
* Introduce visual analytics and the complementary roles of visualisation and data analysis in data science;
* Appreciate that data visualisation is not (just) about making cool looking InfoGraphics, it is about really showing the data in all of its messy detail;
* Know a little about the history of data visualisation and how it has been shaped by factors such  as: presentation technology, human cognitive abilities and limits, societal needs, data availability and the invention of different kinds of information graphics;
* Have first-hand experience in data exploration and visualisation with easy-to-use visual analytics tools like Tableau and with programming languages like R.
* Know about the **What-Why-How** framework for understanding data visualisation design
* Have first-hand experience using the **five design sheet methodology** for designing data visualisations

## How to study for this module 

In this module we draw on material in the public domain, including journal articles and quite a few videos.

In this module there is one assessment activity: creating an interactive data visualisation with Tableau Public.

You should also start your data exploration and visualisation project. By the end of the module you should have identified what you want to investigate and where you are going to get your data from.

Good general introductions to data visualisation and visual analytics are:

* Munzner, Tamara. *Visualization Analysis and Design.* CRC Press, 2014.
* Ward, Matthew O., Georges Grinstein, and Daniel Keim. *Interactive data visualization: foundations, techniques, and applications (2nd Ed).* CRC Press, 2015.

Other more specific references will be mentioned throughout the course.
