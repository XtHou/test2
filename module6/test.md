<mark class="red">As a data scientist you are comfortable using R and Python to interactively explore data. However, often itâ€™s better to use a less powerful but easier to use interactive visualisation tool. This is because programming is slow and error prone, and many analysts are not experienced programmers. Most data analysts find exploring data with Tableau a lot easier than using R.</mark>

<mark class="green">In this topic we look at </mark>how to design such visual analytics tools. While it is unlikely that you will ever be involved in the design or implementation of a really generic tool like Tableau it is quite possible that you may be a part of a team developing a more specialised analytics tool. Scaffold Hunter is an example of such a visual analytics tool. It was originally developed for drug design. To find out more about <mark class="big">Scaffold Hunter</mark> please take a look at the video below. Another good reason for learning about the design space is that it informs more critical evaluation <mark class="highlight">of existing visual analytics tools</mark>.
