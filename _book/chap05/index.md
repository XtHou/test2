# Effective data visualisation: Overview

This is the fifth module in the Data Exploration and Visualisation unit. In this module you will learn about the human visual system and how humans communicate. By understanding these you will be able to design more effective visualisations that take into account human perceptual and cognitive strengths and limitations.

## Aims of this module

After completing this module you will:

* understand how the human visual system works and how this impacts on the design of effective visualisations;
* understand data visualisation as a communication act and the implications of this for effective visualisation design;
* appreciate the need for careful design when visually communicating the results of data analysis to stakeholders;
* be able to design effective data visualisations for communicating the results of data analysis;
* be able to use D3 to construct interactive visualisations.

## How to study for this module

In this module we draw on books, journal and conference articles as well as material in the public domain, including quite a few videos.

In this module there is one assessment activity:

* Programming a simple interactive visualisation using D3.
