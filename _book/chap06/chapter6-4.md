# Activity: Visual analytics tool design

Work in pairs to come up with designs for a visual analytics tool for on-line exploration of the collection of a natural history museum (plants, animals, rocks, fossils etc).

The first step is to identify the tasks and audience the tool is intended to support.

Next come up with various designs for the tool. Mock these up in PowerPoint and show the steps in completing various tasks.

You should prepare designs for two platforms:

1. A standard desktop environment
2. An Oculus Rift equipped with gesture recognition

If you have time now think about an interface for tool running on a Head Mounted Display Augmented Reality display that is for use when you are wandering around the museum.
