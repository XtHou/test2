# Making sense of spatial data: Overview

This is the third module in the FIT5147 Data Exploration and Visualisation unit. In this module you will learn about common graphics for showing spatial data. That is, data that is naturally associated with a geographic location or region and for which you want to explore the data taking this association into account.

## Aims of this module

After completing this module you will:

* have seen standard visualisations for showing spatial data and know when to use them;
* have the ability to choose appropriate map projections and an understanding of their limitations;
* have knowledge of common GIS tools and data formats;
* have first-hand experience with R and the graphics packages **ggmap** and **leaflet** to construct map-based visualisations;
* have some experience using MapBox, a widely used GeoVis tool.

## How to study for this module

In this module we draw on books, journal and conference articles as well as material in the public domain, including a few videos.
