# Making sense of tabular data: Overview

This is the second module in the FIT5147 Data Exploration and Visualisation unit. In this module you will learn about common graphics for showing tabular data. These are the kind of graphics that are common in statistics.

## Aims of this module

After completing this module you will have:

* seen the many standard visualisations (line graphs, bar charts, frequency distributions, time series data etc) for showing tabular data and know when to use them;
* seen standard visualisations for multivariate tabular data (small multiples, MDS etc) and know when to use them;
* the ability to use these visualisation to understand data distributions, to test assumptions such as normality and to guide transformation of data;
* knowledge of curve and surface fitting to data;
* knowledge of data clustering techniques;
* have first-hand experience with R and the graphics package **ggplot2** to
    + read, check, clean and transform data;
    + construct standard visualisations for tabular data, curve fitting, data clustering and to understand data distributions;
    + create interactive visualisations using the package **Shiny**.
    
## How to study for this module

In this module we draw on material in the public domain, including journal articles and quite a few videos. We also have some interviews with data visualisation experts.
